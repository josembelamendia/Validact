# Validact

_A simple JS validation tool with custom messages_

## Get started

_Add "app.js" to your project file_
### How to use ðŸ“‹

To let Validact know that an input field is validable, you must add the class "validable" to that input.
Once the class is set, you will have to add ```data-identifier``` field with an unique name for every field.
If you want to have a validation error message, you will have to add an element with the class ```validation-message```
and link the message with the input adding the same ```data-identifier``` field that the input has.

For example:

```
<label for=""> Name: </label>
<input id="name" type="text" data-identifier="name" class="form-control validable">
<span class="validation-message" data-identifier="name"></span>
```
